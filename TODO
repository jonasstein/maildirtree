maildirtree's TODO list
-----------------------

- Perfect the recursion for read_this_dir.
- Allow reading of all folders that contain new/ and cur/ at least, and ignore
  the rest. May be necessary to have a 'Courier mode' and a 'Hierarchial mode'
  for maildir directory structures that do not use the dot style.
