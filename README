maildirtree
-----------

Maildirtree is a program that will take a flat hierarchy of Maildirs named
for use with the courier-imap IMAP server, like so:

.Folder
.Folder.Sub

Where 'Sub' is a subfolder of 'Folder'. It will print unread message counts
and total message counts (in color) and a totalled summary of the same at the
end. It accepts multiple arguments. It supports only printing the summary.
(A few more things can be discovered after compiling using the man page or
running 'maildirtree -h'.)

Some known things that need improvement can be found in the TODO, and anyone
is welcome to help out.

I hope you find this program useful, but even if you don't, send me some
feedback: joshk@triplehelix.org. Thanks!
