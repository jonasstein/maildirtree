maildirtree installation instructions
-------------------------------------

It's the old configure, make and make install three-step:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c 'make install'

You need nothing other than basically a full set of file manipulation
functions and a getopt function (getopt_long is even better), which should
be available on any halfway decent *nix machine. And you need gmake, 'make'
on all Linux systems and usually gmake otherwise.

You also need docbook-to-man to produce the maildirtree.1 manual page.
