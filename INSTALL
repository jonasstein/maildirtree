maildirtree installation instructions
-------------------------------------

It's the old configure, make and make install three-step:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c 'make install'

You need nothing other than basically a full set of POSIX syscalls and a
getopt function (getopt_long is good too!)

Hope it works out :)
